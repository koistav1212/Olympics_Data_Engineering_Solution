# End to End Olympic Events Data Engineering Solution

## Brief Description
 
The Olympic Data Engineering Solution project is a sophisticated data analytics endeavor that harnesses Olympic data for in-depth analysis of historical performance, participation, and medal distribution across countries and sports. This project utilizes an array of cutting-edge technologies, including HBase for efficient data storage and online analysis, a Sqoop pipeline for streamlined data import, AWS S3 for secure external staging, Azure for cloud-based processing, Hive for batch analysis, Snowflake for data warehousing and cloud-based analytics, and Power BI for intuitive data visualization. By leveraging these tools and platforms, the project ensures scalability, real-time data updates, and insightful data visualization, facilitating comprehensive insights into the world of Olympic sports.

## Business Problem

The project aims to provide valuable insights into Olympic performance trends, country-wise medal distribution, and sport-specific achievements. These insights are crucial for informing strategic decisions, investments, and providing relevant information to stakeholders, sponsors, and athletes.

## Solution Approach

1. **Data Collection:** Gather Olympic Games data from diverse sources, including MySQL databases, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob storage.

2. **Data Storage:** Store and manage the collected data efficiently to support analysis and reporting.

3. **Data Staging:** Utilize ETL processes, including Sqoop, Copy-Into, and Snowpipe, for data ingestion and staging.

4. **Data Integration:** Integrate the staged data into storage and analysis platforms, including Hive for data querying, HBase for NoSQL data storage, and Snowflake for data warehousing.

5. **Data Analysis:** Perform comprehensive data analysis to derive meaningful insights from the Olympic Games data.

6. **Insights Delivery:** Leverage Power BI to create data visualizations and reports, enabling stakeholders to access actionable insights.

## Objectives

- Ingest Olympic Games data from various sources into the data ecosystem.
- Transform and store the data efficiently to enable analysis.
- Enable data analysis and reporting capabilities to derive insights from Olympic Games data.
- Ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations and standards throughout the project.

## Project Stages

1. **Data Collection Stage:** In this stage, data is sourced from multiple locations, including MySQL databases, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob storage.

2. **Ingestion/ETL Stage:** Data is ingested and transformed using ETL processes, including Sqoop for data import, Copy-Into for external staging, and Snowpipe for real-time ingestion.

3. **Storage/Analysis Stage:** Data is stored and made available for analysis in platforms such as Hive for querying, HBase for NoSQL storage, and Snowflake for data warehousing.

4. **Power BI Stage:** In the final stage, Power BI is utilized for data visualization and reporting, enabling stakeholders to access insights and make informed decisions based on Olympic Games data.
